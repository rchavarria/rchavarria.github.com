### Por qué lo he leído

Pues la verdad es que no sé muy bien por qué. Podría entrar en la categoría de libros
de autoayuda, pero una vez leído siento que el libro no está dirigido a personas
como yo. Habla mucho de las personas de éxito y demás, y yo me considero más una
persona normal, nada de un famosete o algo así.

Vi que el libro lo recomendaba [Derek Sivers], que me parece razón suficiente, y
quizá el autor lo haya oído por ahí, por el podcast de Tim Ferris, no sé, me
suena de algo. Pero sobretodo por la recomendación.

## Notas tomadas

### El prólogo doloroso

El ego es el enemigo, y el obstáculo es el camino

### Introducción

El ego siempre estuvo ahí. Y ahora está envalentonado. Allá donde estés, el ego está ahí también.

En un momento cualquiera de la vida, la gente se encuentra en alguna de estas
fases:

1. Aspirando a algo más
2. Ha alcanzado el éxito
3. Ha fracasado

### Aspirar

Da lo mismo a lo que aspires, el ego es tu enemigo

En esta fase, debes practicar verte a tí mismo con un poco de distancia, cultivando
la habilidad de salir de tu propia mente. El desapego es un antídoto natural para
el ego. Es fácil estar emocionalmente enamorado de tu propio trabajo. Cualquira
puede hacerlo. Lo que es raro no es el talento natural, las habilidades o incluso
la confianza. Lo que es raro es la humildad, la diligencia y la consciencia de 
sí mismo.

### Hablar, hablar, hablar

Hablar en lugar de hacer es una tentación que existe para todo el mundo. 

Los espacios en blanco piden ser llenados con pensamientos, fotos e historias. Debemos
llenarlos con lo que vamos a hacer, no con lo que hacemos o hemos hecho.

Muchos de nosotros, cuando un proyecto nos asusta o nos sentimos sobrepasados por él,
hacemos cualquier cosa, menos enfocarnos en él (es como procrastinar, pero peor)

La mayoría de la gente es decente a la hora de generar espectativas sobre lo que
está trabajando. Pero, ¿que es lo que más escasea? El silencio. 

La única relación entre el trabajo y el parloteo es que el uno mata al otro.

No hables tanto, ni siquiera a ti mismo y haz el trabajo duro. Lucha contra las 
ganas de parar para hablar.

### Ser o hacer?

Tener autoridad no es lo mismo que serla. Tener un derecho y tener razón (juego
de palabras en inglés: have right Vs be right) tampoco. Ser ascendido no tiene
porqué significar que te lo merezcas.

¿Cuál es tu propósito? ¿Qué haces aquí? Porque tener un propósito te ayuda a
responder la pregunta: ser o hacer?

### Convertirse en estudiante

El poder de ser un estudiante no es solo que es un período largo de instrucción,
también pone el ego y la ambición en manos de otro. Uno sabe que no es mejor que
el maestro.

Método más, menos e igual: cada luchador, para llegar a ser grande, necesita tener
alguien mejor que él del que aprender, peor que él para enseñarle y alguien similar
con el que poder desafiarse mutuamente.

No solamente necesitamos aceptar el feedback severo y crítico, debemos buscarlo
actívamente, debemos buscar lo negativo precisamente cuando nuestros familiares,
amigos y cerebro nos dicen que lo estamos haciendo muy bien.

### No seas apasionado
La pasión, normalmente, enmascara una debilidad. Su falta de respiración, 
impetuosidad y locura desesperada (breathlessness, impetuousness, franticness) 
son pobres sustitutos de la disciplina, maestría, fuerza, propósito y
perseverancia.

Deja la pasión para los aficionados. Utilízala para lo que sientes que tienes
que hacer y decir, no para lo que quieres ser.

### Sigue la estategia del lienzo (canvas)

Encuentra *lienzos* para que otras personas pinten sobre ellos. Despeja el camino
para la gente por encima de tí y al final crearás un camino para tí.

La estategia del lienzo (canvas strategy) va de ayudarte a tí mismo ayudando a
los demás.

### Contente, domínate a tí mismo

Enfadarse, volverse muy emocional, perder los nervios: es una receta para fallar.

Cuando quieres hacer algo grande, espera que las reacciones varíen desde la
indiferencia hasta el sabotaje más abierto.

Cuando los demás te tratan mal, no te rebajan a tí, se rebajan ellos.

### Sal de tu propia cabeza

Vivir con claridad y en el presente demanda coraje. No vivas en la confusión de 
lo abstracto, vive con lo tangible y real, incluso si (espcialmente si) es 
incómodo. Se parte de lo que te rodea.

### El peligro de un orgullo prematuro

El orgullo, incluso de logros reales, es una distracción y nos engaña.

Nuestra habilidad de aprender, adaptarnos, de ser flexibles, de construir
relaciones, todo esto es nublado/apagado por el orgullo.

La pregunta a hacerse, cuando uno se siente orgulloso, es la siguiente: ¿qué me
estoy perdiendo ahora mismo que una persona más humilde estaría viendo?

### Trabaja, trabaja, trabaja

Acepta que tener una idea no es suficiente, debes trabajar.

Llegar hasta donde queremos ir, no es una cuestión de ser brillante, si no de
un esfuerzo contínuo.

Cuando no estás practicando, recuerda, alguien, en algún sitio está practicando,
y cuando os encontréis, él te ganará.

Cada vez que te pones a trabajar, recuérdate a ti mismo: estoy retrasando una
gratificación al hacer esto, estoy haciendo una inversión en mí en lugar de 
invertir en mi ego.

Tienes que volver a ponerte manos a la obra: practicar, trabajar, mejorar.

En lugar de *Fake it 'till you make it*, a él le gusta decir *Make it so that
you don't have to fake it*

### Para todo lo que está por venir, el ego es el enemigo

### Parte 2: Exito

Success is intoxicating, yet to sustain it requires sobriety. We can’t keep learning if we think we already know everything.

we might think that success in the future is just the natural next part of the story—when really it’s rooted in work, creativity, persistence, and luck.
Instead of pretending that we are living some great story, we must remain focused on the execution—and on executing with excellence.

Ego leads to envy
The farther you travel down that path of accomplishment, whatever it may be, the more often you meet other successful people who make you feel insignificant.
it’s not about beating the other guy. It’s not about having more than the others.
ENTITLEMENT, CONTROL, AND PARANOIA

we begin to overestimate our own power.
It’s human to think that since it’s been done once—that the world was changed in some big or small way—that there is now a magical power in our possession.
MANAGING YOURSELF
Most of us are not the president, or even president of a company, but in moving up the ladder in life, the system and work habits that got us where we are won’t necessarily keep us there.
As you become successful in your own field, your responsibilities may begin to change. Days become less and less about doing and more and more about making decisions.
Such is the nature of leadership.
BEWARE THE DISEASE OF ME

Yes, we are small. We are also a piece of this great universe and a process.

Most successful people are people you’ve never heard of. They want it that way. It keeps them sober. It helps them do their jobs.

instead of taking what we have for granted, we’d be better to spend our time preparing for the shifts of fate that inevitably occur in life. That is, adversity, difficulty, failure.

FAILURE
chance of failure or setbacks. Bill Walsh says, “Almost always, your road to victory goes through a place called ‘failure.’” In order to taste success again, we’ve got to understand what led to this moment (or these years) of difficulty, what went wrong and why. We must deal with the situation in order to move past it. We’ll need to accept it and to push through it.

We must deal with the situation in order to move past it. We’ll need to accept it and to push through it.
When we face difficulty, particularly public difficulty (doubters, scandals, losses), our friend the ego will show its true colors. Absorbing the negative feedback, ego says: I knew you couldn’t do it. Why did you ever try? It claims: This isn’t worth it. This isn’t fair. This is somebody else’s problem. Why don’t you come up with a good excuse and wash your hands of this?
The only way out is through.

ALIVE TIME OR DEAD TIME?
Every moment of failure, every moment or situation that we did not deliberately choose or control, presents this choice: Alive time. Dead time.
When injustice or the capriciousness of fate are inflicted on someone, the normal reaction is to yell, to fight back, to resist. You know the feeling: I don’t want this. I want ______. I want it my way. This is shortsighted.

If ego holds sway, we’ll accept nothing less than full appreciation.
Will we work hard for something that can be taken away from us? Will we invest time and energy even if an outcome is not guaranteed? With the right motives we’re willing to proceed. With ego, we’re not.

Does everyone take advantage of that opportunity? Of course not. Ego often causes the crash and then blocks us from improving.
Face the symptoms. Cure the disease. Ego makes it so hard—it’s easier to delay, to double down,

middle.”) This is characteristic of how great people think. It’s not that they find failure in every success. They just hold themselves to a standard that exceeds what society might consider to be objective success. Because of that, they don’t much care what other people think; they care whether they meet their own standards.

ALWAYS LOVE

In the Internet age, we call this the Streisand effect
Attempting to destroy something out of hate or ego often ensures that it will be preserved and disseminated forever.
to quote his lyrics, “smile[d] its blacktooth grin.” This obsession with the past, with something that someone did or how things should have been, as much as it hurts, is ego embodied. Everyone else has moved on, but you can’t, because you can’t see anything but your own way.

Does this get us any closer to where we want to be? No.
FOR EVERYTHING THAT COMES NEXT, EGO IS THE ENEMY . . .
the old Celtic saying tells us, “See much, study much, suffer much, that is the path to wisdom.”
Aspiration leads to success (and adversity). Success creates its own adversity (and, hopefully, new ambitions). And adversity leads to aspiration and more success. It’s an endless loop.
EPILOGUE
what is most obvious but most ignored is that perfecting the personal regularly leads to success as a professional, but rarely the other way around.
