### 2 Clean Code

#### 2.1 Developers Life is a Trade-Off

There is no silver bullet and one of the most important skills every developer needs to hone is to assess possibilities and to find the best trade-off for the current challenge.

One of the most important tasks of a developer is to make trade-offs.

you need to be able to reflect your decisions and be prepared to revise them.

#### 2.2 Never Use null

Use a so called null object if you need a default instance which does nothing.

todavia no tengo claro si lanza excpcin o no

If a value could not be found do not return null but throw an exception

#### 2.3 Struct classes in PHP

### 3 Object Oriented Design

#### 3.1 Learn OOD - to unlearn it again

As can be seen in many projects, working at the fast feature pace often led to big ball of mud (BBOM) code bases, which reduced the agility of the project day by day, eventually leading to the stage where changes are costly and developers demanded yet another re-write to free themselves of legacy hell. This

The solution to the mismatch of fast change and clean code is the art of refactoring.

Automatic testing and continuous refactoring are the key methodologies

In order to master agility, fast feature pace and high quality code at the same time, every developer needs to learn the art of refactoring and automated testing.

#### 3.2 Object lifecycle control

#### 3.3 Ducks Do Not Type

si una clase implementa una interfaz i clas abstracta. no deberia añadoir nuevos metodos publicos

We have an abstract base type for HTTP clients (which could also be an interface (See: Abstract Classes vs. Interfaces)) and one implementation. Implementations then sometimes tend to define additional public methods, like setConfiguration() in this case, for various different reasons. I want to explain why I consider this a code smell.

#### 3.4 Abstract Classes vs. Interfaces

#### 3.5 ContainerAware Considered Harmful

#### 3.6 Code Reuse By Inheritance

#### 3.7 Utilize Dynamic Dispatch

mas o menis como inyeccion de depndenias. qu cambia de implementacion en tiemoo de ejecucion

This is what we call dynamic dispatch.

compara un trait con una llamada estatica. porque dice que no puedes cambiarla en tiempo de ejecuion. y en part tiene razon. peo no lo veo del too cierto

A trait is static dispatch, too.

#### 3.8 When to Abstract?

abstraction is a bet on the future development of the software

The circumstances will change, so will the view on the best abstraction change.

Do not abstract before you are sure about the actual requirements and before there is a need to do so.

### 4 Testing

#### 4.1 Finding the right Test-Mix

Once the software stabilizes, you should refactor tests from the acceptance-and integration-levels towards the unit-test-level.

Unit-tests are necessary to stabilize your code, but when you know the requirements are not stable yet, then having too many unit-tests can be a burden as well.

4.1.1 The Test-Mix Tradeoff

4.1.1 The Test-Mix Tradeoff

TDD is about design and not about unit-testing and 100% coverage.

Using acceptance- and integration-tests is a valid approach for TDD and serves well during periods of spikes and frequent requirement changes.

#### 4.2 Mocking with Phake

There are two ways to create these test doubles: You can write them yourself or use one of the many existing libraries.

PHPUnit mocks and Mockery require expectations to be part of the "setup" phase.

This is unfortunate, because mock expectations are much more related to the "Verify" phase instead.

because they don't explicitly differentiate between methods that are mocked (verification) or stubbed (returning results). Phake introduces a differentiation

#### 4.3 Testing Effects of Commands With Phake::capture()

See after the \Phake::capture($order) call, the $order variable contains the argument that

See after the \Phake::capture($order) call, the $order variable contains the argument that was passed to the OrderRepository from your code.

#### 4.4 Using Mink in PHPUnit

you can easily do this using the Mink library. Mink is well known from the Behat community to facilitate Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD),

#### 4.5 Introduction To Page Objects

The Page Objects maps the HTML (or JSON) to an object oriented structure you can interact with and assert on.

This already is the nice thing with page objects. The test are readable

the logic must be implemented in the Page Object. By implementing it in a Page Object it is re-usable in other tests

Since end-to-end tests also will always be slow'ish (compared to unit tests) we advise to only write those tests for critical parts of your application.

#### 4.6 Database Tests With PHPUnit

All decisions boil down to: More test atomicity leads to longer test runs, and we can buy test speed by omitting test atomicity.

4.6.1 Removing Data versus Schema Reset

Resetting the full schema is the cleanest approach, but also takes the most time. Resetting a selected number of tables is faster, but also more cumbersome and error-prone.

ademas. borrar los datos no siempre ocurre. oor errores o porque se te olvida. lo que provoca side effects

Except for very small and simple projects it is usually best to initialize the database before each test class.

no estoy de acuerdo. eso seguro que sera muy lento. y sigues teniendo side effects

#### 4.7 Database Fixture Setup in PHPUnit

The way you initialise your database fixtures depends on your test schema management.

The way you initialise your database fixtures depends on your test schema management. We suggest to reset schemas at the begin of each test case and creating the data right in the test case.

The way you initialise your database fixtures depends on your test schema management.

#### 4.8 Using Traits With PHPUnit

Why would traits ever be considered a code smell?

There is no reason for dynamic dispatch.

en un test probablemente no quiero dynamic dispatch

A trait establishes a dependency to another class which is defined by the name of the trait

Traits establish a static dependency which is hard to mock and hard to replace during runtime

But we will never mock our test cases,

And there are no other options.

porque no hay forma de psasr parametros al constructor de u  test

#### 4.9 Testing the Untestable

function file_get_contents($path) {     if (preg_match('~^https?://~', $path) {         // Load some fixture here     }     // Call the original here     return \file_get_contents($path);

es posible mockear funciones globales en codigo con namespace. luego. para llamar a la original hay que poner la barra invertida delante

#### 4.10 Outside-In Testing and the Adapter and Facade Patterns

Outside-In testing leads to interfaces that are written from what is useful for the client object using them, in contrast to objects that are composed of collaborators that already exist.

we have written code that is entirely written in our business domain and uses concepts from this domain.

The technique stays the same: Think in terms of what you want the API to look from the outside and invent collaborators that help you think about the problem. Then implement them until you get to the "leafs" of the object graph. Only the leafs should actually contain code to third party software.

#### 4.11 Behavior Driven Development

#### 4.12 Code Coverage with Behat

There is generally no point in having code coverage for Behat test cases because of their nature: The purpose of an acceptance test

there is still a scenario where you want to peek at code coverage of Behat tests: When creating them as wide-coverage tests before starting to refactor legacy code.

#### 4.13 Testing Micro Services

we moved away from the classical testing approach for our end-to-end tests and instead focused on metrics.

In order to perform a system test, we install all micro services into a single VM.

systems with entry points to our application. These "emulation daemons" feed the system with randomized but production-like data and actions.

#### 4.14 Five Tips to Improve Your Unit Testing

Be Pragmatic About a "Unit"

Test Where the Logic is

getters/setters, constructors and so on. Please do not test these trivials explicitely.

getters/setters, constructors and so

Please do not test these trivials explicitely.

look where there really is logic.

Continuously Refactor Test Code

Never change production and test code at the same time.

Keep test code simple. Simple does not mean dirty, it means easy to read and understand.

fixtures

custom assertions

Identify the patterns that evolve in your test suite and reduce duplication by extracting utilities.

Whenever you encounter a bug in your software, write a test that fails due to this bug and fix the bug afterwards.

important for your users and therefore deserves a test. The pure existence of the bug shows that there is room for another test.

### 5 Refactoring

#### 5.1 Loving Legacy Code

The business rules that the appplication is meant to reflect are already written down in code.

#### 5.2 Refactoring with the Advanced Boy Scout Rule

If you managed to fix it, commit and resume your original work.

when refactoring...

If you did not manage to resolve the issue within $x (maybe 15-20) minutes:

Revert the refactoring attempt

Add a @refactor annotation

If there already is a @refactor annotation, append a ! to it

After 1-2 sprints, grep your code for @refactor

#### 5.3 Extended Definition Of Done

define them as a guide for code reviews which are then part of the "Definition Of Done" for the team. This also means that the team gets clear guidelines for Code Reviews and the reviewer knows what to look for.

common rules for code structure and patterns on top of what PSR-2 defines are helpful for

#### 5.4 How to Refactor Without Breaking Things

Baby Steps

Chances that you will get through a large refactoring

Chances that you will get through a large refactoring without being disturbed are low.

#### 5.5 Getting Rid of static

The original Cache class will always be called, thus we will always test the Cache class together with the UserService. This is, by definition, not an Unit Test any more.

Step 1: Replaceable Singletons

Why is this still problematic?

Global side effects

More complex test setup

Anything messing unnecessarily with the test code can be considered bad.

Step 2: Service Locator

Step 3: Dependency Injection

Problems with using a Service Locator are:

Still global side effects

Hidden dependencies

Make everything testable

Make everything testable

Use Dependency Injection for all your code

This seems like a lot of work and it really is. But most of the work can actually be taken over by

you achieved actually two goals by doing this:

Make everything testable

Extract application configuration

dependencies only when the route is called. You can even replace the code above by using simple Dependency Injection Containers like Pimple

#### 5.6 Refactoring Should not Only be a Ticket

If your team accepts refactoring as an essential part of every work they perform, you will experience how fast your code base will improve

If your team accepts refactoring as an essential part of every work they perform, you will experience how fast your code base will improve at exactly the places you work on a lot.

#### 5.7 Extracting Data Objects

Too Many Parameters

issues

It is really hard to remember which parameter is at which position,

additional information will require you to add even more parameters

introducing more mandatory data will even force you to change the parameter order

Associative Arrays

is therefore a good idea to replace any associative array structure with a data object

is therefore a good idea to replace any associative array structure with a data object

them a really good tool for prototyping,

real pain:

no defined way to document array structures so the IDE will not be able to tell you which fields exist, what their purpose is and what type the fields expect.

there is a high risk for typos.

people will eventually add whatever they need at a single place

replace any associative array structure with a data object once the structure has stabilized a bit.

Smooth Migration

5.7.3.1 Create a New Method

5.7.3.2 Dispatch Old Method To New

5.7.3.3 Change Use Case

5.7.3.4 Iterate

#### 5.8 Basic Refactoring Techniques: Extract Method

Just understanding each step helps you selecting the best code blocks for refactoring, something that PHPStorm cannot do for you.

As a rule of thumb, code in a method should work on the same level of abstraction

5.8.1 Step 1: Identify code fragment to extract

5.8.2 Step 2: Create empty method and copy code

5.8.3 Step 3: Identify undeclared variables that must be arguments

5.8.4 Step 4: Identify variables that are still used in old method

All variables of this kind must be returned from the new method

5.8.5 Step 5: Call new method from original method

5.8.6 Risky Extract Method Checklist

Arrays are not passed by reference,

Side effects to instance variables

check this more carefully when your extracted method is called in a loop.

Variables that are declared before and used after the extracted method

5.8.7 Fin

5.9 How to Perform Extract Service Refactoring

#### 5.9 How to Perform Extract Service Refactoring When You Don't Have Tests

The primary risk of failure is the temptation to do too many steps at the same time, delaying the re-execution and verification that the code still works

5.9.1 Step 1: Create Class and Copy Method

5.9.2 Step 2: Fix Visibility, Namespace, Use and Autoloading

5.9.3 Step 3: Check for Instance Variable Usage

instance variable that is only used in the extracted method itself.

Then you can copy (don't delete it just yet) the variable to the new service.

instance variable is another object that is injected into the originals class constructor or with setter injection. Copy

instance variable is used for state that is only read in the new class.

pass it as a new argument

instance variable is used for state that is read, changed or both in the new class.

pass it to a setter

retrieve it back with a getter

Don't be discouraged if the first attempts lead to nothing or weird APIs, remember that refactoring is a constant process and intermediate steps may actually make the code worse.

5.9.4 Step 4: Use New Class Inline

5.9.5 Step 5: Inline Method

5.9.6 Step 6: Move Instantiation into Constructor or Setter

5.9.7 Step 7: Cleanup Dependency Injection

5.9.8 Fin

#### 5.10 How You Can Successfully Ship New Code in a Legacy Codebase

good strategy for this kind of change is called "Branch By Abstraction".

introduce an abstraction in your code-base and implement the branching part by selecting different implementations of this abstraction at runtime.

5.10.1 Example 1: Replacing the Backend in a CMS

5.10.2 Example 2: Rewriting a submodule without changing public API

We built a new mail parser from scratch with a nice new API.

The code was feature flagged to our new customer first:

5.10.3 Example 3: Github reimplements Merge button

They refactored the old code into a dedicated method and then wrote new code with the same method signature.

5.10.4 The Process

We have several "Clients" (classes, functions) which use and probably implement an implicitly defined concept like in one of the examples above.

5.10.4.1 Step 1: Refactoring The First Client

We create a new API for this.

While moving the old code we also create an abstraction

5.10.4.2 Step 2: Iterate Across Clients

You will have to adapt the Facade and the abstraction during this process.

5.10.4.3 Step 3: Finish The Clients

If the code is working well enough and we do not have to change it often it is valid to just keep it there and ignore

5.10.4.4 Step 4: Starting a new Implementation

5.10.4.4 Step 4: Starting a new Implementation

por ahora. lo que tenemos es solo la fachada. nada de una nueva imple.entacion

5.10.4.4 Step 4: Starting a new Implementation

is just unmaintainable we can start with this now. We have an abstraction which we "just" need to implement. Please do this test-driven.

We have an abstraction which we "just" need to implement. Please do this test-driven.

The Verifier knows the legacy Facade and the new code – it also implements the abstraction.

The Verifier now always calls the Facade wrapping the old code and the new implementation and compares their output.

librerias como sciencetist ayudan a esto

5.10.4.5 Step 5: Delete the Old Code

5.10.5 Conclusion

#### 5.11 Extracting Value Objects

code smell that is widespread in every codebase I have ever seen and is called "Primitive Obsession".

our example we are missing a DateRange

allow us to heavily unit-test business logic related to date ranges.

5.12 Refactoring Singleton Usage to get Testable Code

To make this code testable without the singleton, we can use the lazy initialization pattern.

Since you would want to use constructor injection for all mandatory dependencies you could also introduce an optional constructor argument,

### 6 Architecture

#### 6.1 Why Architecture is Important

There are even studies 2 pointing out the costs of bugs in your architecture. If they are discovered late, when the system is already in production, then fixing these bugs can amplify the costs hundredfold.

One of the things which are hardest to repair in existing systems are inconsistencies of your data.

What are the main points you should check when designing a system architecture

How can the consistency of data be ensured across multiple systems?

How do we verify that the chosen systems fulfil their requirements? What are the technical and operational risks of newly introduced systems? How will the system handle latencies and failures of nodes? Is the overall application resilient against single node failures

6.1.1 Summary

#### 6.2 Scaling Constraints of Languages

6.2.1 Why PHP?

One reason is LCoDC$SS

The abbreviations which describes the network architectural properties of HTTP / REST stands for:

Layered (L)

Code on Demand (CoD)

rendering does not happen on the server.

Client-Server (CS)

Cached ($)

Stateless (S)

PHP

handles stateless HTTP requests perfectly.

6.2.2 So, Why Not PHP?

Besides HTTP browsers also speak other protocols like WebSocket.

cycle but bi-directional permanent connections. PHP is not built for this.

6.2.2.1 Node.js

What I like to use Node.js for is quickly developing simple servers.

6.2.2.2 Go

6.2.2.3 Java

6.2.3 Summary

Choosing the language (virtual machine) is not just a matter of taste.

developer experience,

license costs

different paradigms

#### 6.3 How To Synchronize a Database With ElasticSearch?

naiive approach of synchronizing both data storages. It boils down to: Store data in database Store data in search index

The problem with this approach is, as in any distributed system, that both the first and the second write will fail at some point.

data inconsistency

6.3.1 Transactions

6.3.2 Changes Feed

is a better way to implement this, often used in systems where you have one primary storage and any number of secondary storages.

In this scenario your primary storage defines the state of your system – it is commonly called "Source Of Truth".

What we want to do is passing every change in the database on to the search index.

Any other system, like your search index or caches should be updated based on the state in the database.

What we want to do is passing every change in the database on to the search index.

With the last sequence number returned from the target system we can now load all or just a batch of changes from our database.

6.3.3 Generating Correct Sequence Numbers

The easiest way to implement this is an additional table

6.3.4 Storing The Sequence Number

6.3.5 Conclusion

#### 6.4 Common Bottlenecks in Performance Tests

true for optimizations in your PHP code but also for optimizations regarding your infrastructure. We should measure before we try to optimize and waste time.

PHP scripts you'd use XDebug and KCacheGrind or something like Tideways

6.4.1 System Test Setup

6.4.2 Stack Analysis

configurar una herramienta para simular los pasos que un usuarios tipico haria en tu página 

ejecutar esos tests y monitorizar cpu. memoria. red...

6.4.3 It is Not Always The Database

Edge Side Includes (ESI) We tested a large online shop which used ESI so extensively that the application servers running PHP were actually the problem.

Network File System (NFS) locking issues

Broken server configurations

Opcode cache failures

But this is also something you will not notice without putting the system under load.

6.4.4 Summary

#### 6.5 Embedding REST Entities

6.5.1 Entities

As an example I chose the resources Product and Category

As an example I chose the resources Product and Category from the e-commerce domain.

Note that here is a list of product items linked from a category,

6.5.2 The Use-Case

API is to retrieve the top 20 products from a category.

API is to retrieve the top 20 products from a category. To retrieve these together with product details, a client needs 21 GET requests on the first go.

6.5.3 Resource Embedding with HAL

Hypertext Application Language (HAL)

HAL encodes any resource using the <resource> tag and has its own <link> tag.

6.5.4 Better Resource Embedding

6.5.5 Bottom Line

### 7 Workflow

#### 7.1 Coding in Katas

if you want to grow beyond yourself, you need to create an environment for your practice where failure is allowed.

The actual result of this work is only a secondary concern, same applies to finishing the task. What counts is the actual practice.

The important part is to reflect on what you did:

How did you approach the problem?

Where did your approach lead you?

What were the problems?

#### 7.2 Why you need infrastructure and deployment automation

The amount of time wasted on setup, synchronization and deployment of applications is often ignored by teams and managers.

7.2.1 Can you make a build in one step?

any member of the team and therefore reduces the possibility of errors

argument for introducing a reliable one-step build is that it can be safely triggered by any member of the team and therefore reduces the possibility of errors drastically.

it can be safely triggered by any member of the team and therefore reduces the possibility of errors drastically.

7.2.2 Do you make daily builds?

7.2.3 Do you use configuration management tools to automate infrastructure?

Configuration management tools all solve the problem of consistenly automating the setup of new and old servers.

7.2.4 Is the development setup documented and automated?

7.2.5 Can you rollout and rollback deployments in one step?

asset compilation and database schema migrations that are backwards and forwards compatible.

7.2.6 Can applications be deployed to a new server setup without changes to the code?

hardcoding configuration variables.
